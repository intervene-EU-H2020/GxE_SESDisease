# Project: INTERVENE - Differences by socioeconomic status (SES, as assessed by
# educational attainment [EA]) in risk of 19 common diseases (as
# previously selected in the INTERVENE flagship manuscript + Alcohol Use
# Disorder: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.12.23291186)
#
# Author: F.A. Hagenbeek [FAH] (fiona.hagenbeek@helsinki.fi)
#
# Script: Create combined phenotype and PRS RData files for running analyses
# where EA is the socioeconomic index and PGSs are converted to strata
#
# Required input data: biobank-specific INTERVENE phenotype file and
# biobank-specific INTERVENE PGS files
